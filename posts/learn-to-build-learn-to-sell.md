This is the second post to my feed section. I'm excited to share how I decided to expand my sales-driven expertise into the intriguing world of coding.

## Discovering a New Paradigm

So, there I was, knee-deep in the world of sales, doing my thing and thinking I had it all figured out. But then, listening to some podcasts, I stumbled upon this quote by Naval Ravikant:

> "Learn to build, learn to sell. If you can do both, you will be unstoppable."

It hit me like a ton of bricks. Suddenly, I realized there was a whole other world out there waiting for me, and I had to dive in headfirst.

## Specialisation is not for me

Sales had taught me a lot - how to build strong relationships with people, close deals, and soft skills. But as the digital age kept marching on, I started feeling like something was missing, specially in a world of tech-savvy entrepreneurs. It was time to level up my game.

Being able to expand my knowledge is extremely valuable. I don't believe in specialisation, it's boring to focus your life on just one particular thing.

## Taking the Plunge into Coding

So, I decided to take the plunge into the wild world of coding. Let me tell you, it was a bumpy ride. Prior to this decision, I had never written a single line of code. But with every line of code I wrote, I felt a sense of accomplishment like never before.

## The Fusion of Sales and Coding

But here's the kicker - learning to code wasn't just about picking up a new skill. It was about combining that newfound knowledge with my sales savvy. If I can sell solutions for others, I can definitely sell them for myself. And I just figured out how to build the solution to sell.

## Overcoming Challenges

At first, learning to code is easy when you are introduced to the basics with HTML, CSS and some really noob-level JavaScript. But nothing worth mastering comes easy. It requires a lot of practice, patience and perseverance. I studied and practiced coding at least - on average - 5 hours daily.

## The Current Output

I have built projects that never in my life I thought I would be able to build. And more is yet to come, but I'm on the right track. Building solutions for daily problems (for myself and the community) is what I aim for.

## Conclusion: The Journey Continues

Looking back, I can't believe how far I've come. From sales to coding, it's been one heck of a journey. But you know what they say - fortune favors the bold. So, if you're thinking about making the leap, just remember these words: Learn to build, learn to sell, and watch as the world becomes your playground.
